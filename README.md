<h1>Odin Landing Page!</h1>

Hello World! This is a HTML/CSS landing-page with The Odin Project! Will experience turning a design, into code. Dive deeper into HTML, and polish my flexbox skills.

<strong>What Went Well?</strong>

<ul>
  <li> Effectively utilised the box model to apply neccessary margin and padding, which creates the article-style layout </li>
  <li> Experimented with flexbox properties, particularly justify-content and align-items to position our content. Leveraged the flex-direction property to dynamically </li>
  <li> integrate column layout. </li>
  <li> Learnt to apply filters to style images in CSS. Turning the background colors for our images to be more transparent. </li>
</ul>

<strong>What Could I Improve?</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Would have liked to use more properties for flex items, as I struggled to conceptualise flex grow, shrink and basis. Although, I may go back and refine the page to reinforce these concepts. </li>
  <li> Need to utilise margin and padding better for containers, in order to present an object-fit that interconnect the sections. </li>
</ul>
