Hello World! This is a HTML/CSS landing-page with The Odin Project! Will experience turning a design, into code. Dive deeper into HTML, and polish my flexbox skills.

What Went Well?

- Effectively utilised the box model to apply neccessary margin and padding, which creates the article-style layout
- Experimented with flexbox properties, particularly justify-content and align-items to position our content. Leveraged the flex-direction property to dynamically integrate column layout.
- Learnt to apply filters to style images in CSS. Turning the background colors for our images to be more transparent.

What Could I Improve? 

- Would have liked to use more properties for flex items, as I struggled to conceptualise flex grow, shrink and basis. Although, I may go back and refine the page to reinforce these concepts.
- Need to utilise margin and padding better for containers, in order to present an object-fit that interconnect the sections.
